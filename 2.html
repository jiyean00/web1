  <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
  including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content
  accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
  presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting
  by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
  complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the
  .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
   share the file and its formatting.</p>

 <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same
  markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
  on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
  and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
  formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
