   target="_blank" title="html5.2 specification"> html</a> is the first line of our java program. Every java application must have at
  least one class definition that consists of class keyword followed by class na
  me. When I say keyword, it means that it should not be changed, we should use
  it as it is. However the class name can be anything.</p>
 <img src="coding.jpg" width="400">
 <p>I have made the class public by using public access modifier, I will cover acc
 ess modifier in a separate post, all you need to know now that a java file can
  have any number of classes but it can have only one public class and the file
  name should be same as public class name.</p>
